# Global Traffic Accidents EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis of the Global Traffic Accidents Dataset.

## Overview
This project analyzes traffic accident data to uncover patterns in casualties, causes, and trends over time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/global-traffic-accidents-dataset).
2. Place `global_traffic_accidents.csv` in the project folder.
3. Open `Global_Traffic_Accidents_Dataset_EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.

## Key Findings
- ### Most accidents have low casualties <span style='color:green'>(0-5)</span>, with a long tail of rare high-casualty events. 
- ### Analysis of global traffic accident data identifies <span style='color:red'>Drunk Driving</span>, <span style='color:red'>Reckless Driving</span>, and <span style='color:red'>Speeding</span> as primary contributors, underscoring the need for authorities to adopt more stringent legislation and punitive measures targeting such drivers.
- ### Data indicates that road conditions as <span style='color:red'>Under Construction</span> contribute to traffic accidents, and I advise authorities to improve safety by <span style='color:green'>enhancing signage</span>, <span style='color:green'>implementing temporary speed reductions</span>, and <span style='color:green'>ensuring timely completion of construction projects</span>.
